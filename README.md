# CostcoHelper
An app to help scan Costco receipts and allocate purchases to different people to split the bill

## Features
* Scan Costco receipt and get every row with all of the data from it
* Allow users to mark off items that different people purchased (allowing multiple to split the same purchase)
* Properly split up all costs and give a final tally of the cost per person for the total bill

## Stretch Goals
* Integration with Venmo
* Splitting tax based on type of purchase (food, alcohol, electronics)
* Get the full item name from some database by using the reduced item name from the receipt
